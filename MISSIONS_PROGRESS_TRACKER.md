## Notes & Comments

**Tips for Using This Tracker:**
1. Check off missions as you complete and validate them
2. Update "Progress Overview" percentages after each mission
3. Use "Current Sprint" section for weekly planning
4. Don't skip validations - only check when truly complete
5. Update "Last Updated" date when making changes

**Progress Calculation:**
- Total missions: 47 (excluding optionals)
- Each mission = ~2.13% progress
- Update progress bar: each ▱ represents 10%
